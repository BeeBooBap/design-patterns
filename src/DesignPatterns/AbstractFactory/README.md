Like a factory but everything is encapsulated. 
The final objects contain objects that use the DesignPatterns.Strategy pattern (composition - class fields are objects themsleves).

Abstract DesignPatterns.Factory - allows for producing families of related objects without specifying concrete classes. It is a
factory of factories.

This is useful if you have many objects that can added or changed dynamically
at run time.
