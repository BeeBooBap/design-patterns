# ADTs

ADTs are types composed of other types. Either they are a product type (fruit x fruit x fruit)
or they are a sum type (fruit + fruit + fruit).

For example, a product type: Fruit Salad

You can have a banana AND an apple AND a pear.

A sum type: Fruit Snack

You can have a banana OR an apple OR a pear.

In code, a sum type could be var name = String or undefined.

In this way, if you wanted to perform name.ToUpperCase(), it may not work if name is actually
undefined.
